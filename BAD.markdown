### Meet the Group ###

Check out <a href="cosmolab.usc.edu"> USC Astrophysics</a> and Cosmology and <a href="https://github.com/usc-cosmolab/hackspace"> CosmoLab hack space!</a> 

Together with students and postdoc at USC, I have started CosmoLab, now running as a weekly meeting for all USC grads, undergrads, postdocs, and researchers interested in astrophysics research. Get in touch if you'd like to join!

I've had the pleasure to work with many very talented students and postdocs at USC and beyond.
