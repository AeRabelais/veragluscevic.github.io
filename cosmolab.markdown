### Meet the Group ###

Check out <a href="cosmolab.usc.edu"> USC Astrophysics</a> and Cosmology and <a href="https://github.com/usc-cosmolab/hackspace"> CosmoLab hack space!</a> 

Together with students and postdoc at USC, I have started CosmoLab, now running as a weekly meeting for all USC grads, undergrads, postdocs, and researchers interested in astrophysics research. Get in touch if you'd like to join!

I've had the pleasure to work with many very talented students and postdocs at USC and beyond.

### Current: ###


![RuiAn]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/RuiAn.jpg){:width="65%"}

Rui An (postdoc 2021-present): Rui works on constraining the mass and interactions of dark matter and other cosmological probes of new physics.

![Ethan Nadler]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/EthanNadler.jpg){:width="65%"} 

<a href="https://eonadler.github.io/"> Ethan O. Nadler</a> (Carnegie-USC postdoc 2021-present): Ethan works on state-of-the art zoom-in simulations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies, introducing inference to near-field cosmology to robustly search for signatures of new physics in local observables.


![Trey]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/GeorgeDriskell.jpg){:width="65%"}
Trey Driskell (USC PhD student 2030-present): Trey is investigating the global 21-cm signal in context of interacting dark matter models that can change the thermal history of the universe.

![Aryan]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AryanRahimieh.jpg){:width="65%"}

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-rahimieh/"> Aryan Rahimieh </a> (USC PhD student 2019-present): Aryan is working on a novel way to detect interactions of axion-like particles with electrons, using 21-cm line intensity mapping. As his second project, he is working on the Fisher forecasting of global 21-cm signal to put constraints on astrophysical parameters as well as model dependent DM mass and cross section. 

![Wendy]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/WendyCrumrine.jpg){:width="65%"}
<a href="https://brightinsightslearning.com/about-me/"> Wendy Crumrine </a> (USC PhD student 2021-present): Wendy is using Milky Way satellite abundance measurements to derive constraints on non-cold dark matter cosmological models; in particular, models in which dark mater interacts with neutrinos or photons. 

![AdamHe]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AdamHe.jpg){:width="65%"}

Adam He (USC PhD student 2020-present): Adam is using the effective theory of structure formation to enable calculation of non-linear evolution of cosmological perturbations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies.

Resherle Verna (post-bacc student and former USC masters student, class of 2020; now Data Science Specialist at Southern California Edison): Resherle works on visualizations of zoom-in simulations of the Milky Way in non-cold dark matter cosmologies, co-advised by Ethan Nadler.
