Meet the Group

Check out USC Astrophysics and Cosmology and CosmoLab hack space!
<p>
Together with students and postdoc at USC, I have started CosmoLab, now running as a weekly meeting for all USC grads, undergrads, postdocs, and researchers interested in astrophysics research. Get in touch if you'd like to join!

<p>
I've had the pleasure to work with many very talented students and postdocs at USC and beyond.
<p>

**Current:**

![RuiAn]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/RuiAn.jpg){:width="65%"}
<p>
Rui An (postdoc): Rui works on constraining the mass and interactions of dark matter and other cosmological probes of new physics.


![Ethan]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/EthanNadler.jpg){:width="65%"} 

<p>
Ethan Nadler (Carnegie-USC postdoc): Ethan works on state-of-the art zoom-in simulations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies, introducing inference to near-field cosmology to robustly search for signatures of new physics in local observables.
<p>
George (Trey) Driskell (USC grad student): Trey is investigating the global 21-cm signal in context of interacting dark matter models that can change the thermal history of the universe.


![Aryan]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AryanRahimieh.jpg){:width="65%"}

<p>
Aryan Rahimieh (USC grad student): Aryan is working on a novel way to detect interactions of axion-like particles with electrons, using 21-cm line intensity mapping. 
<p>
Wendy Crumrine (grad student): Wendy is investigating dark matter interactions in cosmological context.
<p>

![AdamHe]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AdameHe.jpg){:width="65%"}

Adam He (USC grad student): Adam is using the effective theory of structure formation to enable calculation of non-linear evolution of cosmological perturbations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies.
<p>
Resherle Verna (post-bacc student and former USC masters student, class of 2020; now Data Science Specialist at Southern California Edison): Resherle works on visualizations of zoom-in simulations of the Milky Way in non-cold dark matter cosmologies, co-advised by Ethan Nadler.
 <p>
**Former:**
<p>
Karime Maamari (USC undergrad, class of 2020; now Research Assistant at Argonne): Karime derived the most stringent astrophysical bounds to-date on dark matter-baryon scattering, using Milky Way satellite abundance measurements from DES.
<p>
Dimple Sarnaaik (USC undergrad, class of 2021): Dimple had worked on performing analytic estimates for the bound on dark matter-electron scattering from CMB anisotropy measurements.
<p>
David Nguyen (USC undergrad, class of 2021):  David used Planck data to put some of the strongest observational bounds on dark matter-electron interactions, in collaboration with Dimple Sarnaaik.
<p>
Isabella Johansson (USC master student): Isabella focused on forecasting sensitivity of future CMB experiments to new physics.
<p>
Prayaas Aggarwal (B.S. Physics/Computer Science, USC Class of 2020; now Software/Systems Engineer at Qualcomm): Prayaas  developed this website and the CMB visualization tool for CosmoLab.
<p>
Brenda Zhou (USC undergrad, class of 2021): Brenda investigated early dark energy with Planck data.
<p>
Aizhan Akhmedzanova (Princeton undergrad, class of 2020; now masters student at Perimenter Institute, on to grad school at Harvard): Aizhan has worked on incorporating the effective theory of structure formation into the Boltzmann code CLASS.
<p>
Katelyn Neese (Princeton undergrad, class of 2017; now Metrology Engineer at Newport News Shipbuilding): Katelyn has looked at how annual modulation signal in dark matter direct detection experiments can be used to distinguish dark matter models.
