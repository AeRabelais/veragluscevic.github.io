### USC Astrophysics and Cosmology###

Cosmolab is a group of USC students, postdocs, staff, and faculty doing research in astrophysics and cosmology. We have a weekly meeting for all USC grads, undergrads, postdocs, and researchers interested in astrophysics research. Get in touch if you'd like to join! Check it out <a href="cosmolab.usc.edu"> USC Astrophysics</a> and Cosmology

We come together in a variety of weekly meetings: In CosmoLab (Thursdays), we review new papers and discuss progress and current issues related to research and academia, with occasional Zoom talks by researchers from other institutions. 

We also have CosmoLab Hacks (Fridays), we hack together virtually. Check out <a href="https://github.com/usc-cosmolab/hackspace"> CosmoLab hack space!</a>.

In USC Cosmology Seminar (Fridays), we host formal 1-hour talks by internal and external speakers.
