I am a Gabilan Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/"> University of Southern California </a>. My research focuses on cosmological probes of fundamental physics and aims to unravel some of the biggest mysteries of modern physics: the physical nature of dark matter and dark energy. As a postdoc, I was an Eric Schmidt Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and I got my PhD in astrophysics at Caltech. I began as an undergrad in astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, Serbia.
