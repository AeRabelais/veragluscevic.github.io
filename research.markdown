### Cosmological probes of new physics

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">
As a cosmologist, I study the entire Universe as a physical system. In particular, I combine the tools of theoretical astrophysics, particle physics, and astronomical data analysis in order to probe dark matter, dark energy, and various processes that shaped the Universe before the time of the first stars. My research often involves coming up with new ways of using observations spanning the entire cosmic history---from the cosmic microwave background radiation to populations of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way---in order to test the fundamental fabric of nature. Below are some research highlights; a number of them are done by students under my supervision.

Dark matter direct detection experiments are currently collecting data, in hopes of discovering signal from dark matter particles. In this work, we discuss how Earth's motion around the Sun and the resulting annual modulation of a putative dark-matter signal may be used to distinguish amongst candidate theories that could describe these elusive particles. Check out our dmdd python package.
